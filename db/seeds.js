But Coco and I have been talking a lot about the overall shape of our lives, trying to figure out what having a good life means to us and so this blog is a good way to explore that.'},

From a lot of conversations I\'ve had with friends and acquaintances, I think that\'s quite common. And sharing is caring, so maybe our stories will help you! Or amuse you. Or amuse or help ourselves :) Happy reading!  '}
